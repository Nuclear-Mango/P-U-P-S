# P-U-P-S
A showcase of my (p)ast (U)nity (p)roject(s) as I undertake endeavors in game development. Remember to love your PUPS. 

The first (and currently only) project shown is Knight of Cosmos, a 2D Arcade-style SHMUP where you do none of the shooting. 
This was a team project for one of my game design classes at Drexel created with Unity C# and version controlled through a private repo on GitLab connected with GitKraken.
I created the original game concept and served as the main programmer for both gameplay and animations. HUD, sound design, music, and original art design was handled by my teammates.

Key Features:

-Randomly generated, endless enemy waves for an arcade experience

-Difficulty scaled to wave progression for a satisfying challenge

-An aesthetic mesh of knights and alien tech

-A unique spin on SHMUP combat, focusing on reactive, defensive play to use enemy attacks against them
